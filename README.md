# social-goauth
A package that integrates multiple OAuth logins, including Apple, Google, Facebook, Line, and more.  
It makes our workflow more convenient and simple without the need to search for corresponding packages everywhere.
Currently, it only supports Apple, Google, Facebook, and Line login methods, and I will continue to update and maintain it.
